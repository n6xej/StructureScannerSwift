        // This can cause problems since Structure SDK apps typically ask the user for permission to use the camera when launched.
        // This leads to the user's first experience with a Structure SDK app being:
        //     1.  Download Structure SDK apps from App Store.
        //     2.  Plug in Structure Sensor to iPad.
        //     3.  Get bombarded with "X app wants to use the Camera" notifications from every installed Structure SDK app.
        // Each app has to deal with this problem in its own way.
        // In the Structure SDK, sample apps peacefully exit without causing a crash report.
        // This also has other benefits, such as not using memory.
        // Note that Structure SDK does not support connecting to Structure Sensor if the app is in the background.
